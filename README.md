### Summary: ###
  This project is one of two courses used to learn Altium Designer. It consists of a PCB that improves upon the Arduino Uno(Rev 3) design with better components and more features. You can find the link to this course at [Fedevel Academy](https://academy.fedevel.com/courses/online-want-to-design-your-own-arduino-board), and the repository of the other project [here](https://github.com/jmos1/ISL6236).

  The schematic PDF, 3D PCB PDF, and gerber files can all be accessed in the _'5V Variant Output/'_ folder. Other mechanical drawings are not included because they add clutter and can be generated from the project itself in Altium.
