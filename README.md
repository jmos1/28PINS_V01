### Summary: ###
  This project is one of two courses used to familiarize myself with Altium. It consists of a PCB that improves upon the Arduino Uno(Rev 3) design with better components and more features. You can find the link to the courses at [Fedevel Academy](https://academy.fedevel.com/), and the repository of the second project [here]().

  The schematic PDF and 3D PDF can both be accessed in the _'5V Variant Output/'_ folder and are included for presentation purposes. Gerber files, drill files, and other mechanical drawings are not included because they add clutter and can be generated from the project itself in Altium.
